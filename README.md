# FF7R-UEVR

UEVR plugin that fixes graphical issues and broken UI in FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE.

## Installation

Install the nightly build of UEVR [from here](https://github.com/praydog/UEVR-nightly/releases/latest).

Download the latest release of the plugin from [here](https://github.com/praydog/FF7R-UEVR/releases/latest). Click "Import Config" in the UEVR UI and navigate to the `ff7remake_.zip` from the release and click on it.

D3D11 must be used for now as D3D12 has some issues and crashes. You can do this by passing `-d3d11` to the game's command line arguments.
